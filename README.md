# Tweeter Project

**Tweeter** is a simple, single-page Twitter-esque web app.
Front end is built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. Back end is handled with Node, Express and MongoDB.

Write your Tweeter and click 'Tweet' to post your message to the world.

Messages must be 1 - 140 characters long -- you will be notified by a warning if your Tweeter isn't within the range.

You can also view all previous **Tweeter** messages and see when they were posted.
